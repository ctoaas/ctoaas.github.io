# Hiring

Hiring good developers is hard; finding good candidates is very difficult and current market rates, especially in the UK and US are rising in line with the increased demand and constrained supply. It's not unusual now to see senior developer rates close to Â£100k in London, and even with the expansion of seed stage investment you're not going to get far if you have to hire at those rates. For this reason I feel it's important to develop an "alternative" talent pipeline, bringing in "fresh" talent in a low-cost, low-risk way to supplement more senior hires.

Many recent graduates are unemployable for startups; they haven't spent enough time programming during their degree courses to be effective when they start. This makes them a nett negative on productivity of the team initially, and from that perspective I feel unpaid internships are fair, but I am against unpaid internships because they exclude people who can't afford to participate, and part of an alternative talent pipeline is it should be casting the net as wide as possible.

The job centre offers up-to 2 month work experience placements for people on job-seekers allowance, free for the business. During this period the individual is paid by the job centre; this is a great option for startups - designing a program to bring in suitable people (those with an interest in the skills you need : programming, graphic design, marketing, video, etc) and combine a portion of their time dedicated to a project in their interest area with the more mundane data / admin / manual tasks that need to be done in a startup. This provides both parties with value; the individual gets valuable experience of a real workplace and a real project that they can reference and the startup gets some necessary work done for free. Where appropriate the participants can progress onto either a formal apprenticeship, or an entry level role / paid internship at the end of their 2 months.

When hiring for these programs I'm looking for motivated, personable people with evidence that they have a genuine interest in the area, that they've "got off their a@*e" and done something to progress it. As a group the young and unemployed get a bad press, but I've been fortunate enough to spend time with large groups of them, and there is a sizeable subset of people that just haven't found / been given the right opportunity.

Paid internships provide a way for people with some experience (educational or work) to continue learning their craft without too much expense on the business. Having interns in the team environment; working in the VCS and work tracking system, learning a number of the tools in use in the team, contributing as a junior developer where they can, and being involved in the conversations and debate that occur in a startup office accelerate their learning and reduce the amount of time until they provide value.

Apprenticeships are another option that allows people to learn their skills with a combination of work and formal learning; in my opinion more youngsters should be taking this option as an alternative to degrees. In most cases the government funds all or a large part of the training costs, with the apprentice attending a course on average a day a week or so, and the minimum wage for the apprentice is approx half of the adult minimum wage. Bear in mind that apprenticeships are 1-2 year programs so aren't appropriate for every business.

[I've written before about how to structure a learning program from complete novice](http://www.ctoaas.co/blog/2013/10/21/how-should-i-get-started-coding/), and I tailor a program along these lines for technology apprentices and interns. This program can take a complete novice through to a junior developer role in six to twelve months as long as they're committed.

# The benefits of remote workers

I've spent a lot of time working with offshore development organisations across Eastern Europe, North America and India, Asia, with varying degrees of success. Having team members in cheaper locations can significantly reduce your costs but this is often outweighed by a fall in productivity in both the remote team members and those locally who work with them.

When I talk about remote workers it's important to distinguish between remote / offshore and outsourced:

Outsouring is about handing over control of a business function to an external organisation. Whilst it has advantages, especially where you need a remote team of 20 or more, I don't think it's appropriate for a startup. When you're a small startup team it's important that your business and tech are tightly coupled together and working iteratively. It's difficult to align a 3rd party contractually, and have their own agenda and profitability to think about.

Offshore / remote workers (or local contractors) are members of your delivery team; for me the major differentiator is culture - there's no "us" and "them", they work 100% on your project, they participate in the standups and other team meetings, they understand the business and are bought into the vision, and they're incentivised to make the business successful, ideally with options. The fact that they may not be in the office shouldn't be too much of an issue given the wealth of tools out there (a post on tools will be coming soon).

It's also possible to use a "team augmentation" approach where you take outsourced resource, but treat them as part of your team, this can be a good way to outsource parts of the HR process, but keep the resources culturally within the team.

The choice of offshore location has a massive impact on the type of service you receive. There is a massive cultural difference between the different locations, and whilst the differences would be a blog post in itself, for an agile startup project my experience to date has led me to stick to Eastern Europe and avoid India and Asia. As with everything, start with something small and low-risk to see how the relationship works and only if you're happy move forward with larger, more critical pieces of work.

Odesk is a great tool for sourcing remote candidates, after posting an ad if there are a lot of candidates I'll filter from the applicant list by geography and then send a templated message to everyone I think could be a match with a few questions in it, including a related technical question. It's amazing how many people drop off at this point, allowing me to focus more time on those that do reply. A couple more messages by email and then I'll normally setup a Skype or google hangout text or audio / video call as appropriate to get more into detail.

When I'm down to those I think are suitable, I'll start a few of them off with a small low-risk task of a day or so to see how we work together. 

# Finding candidates
The process to find local, full time permanent employees will normally take two to four months from starting the search to the person starting. This is especially true for senior hires, but if you're hiring at the right times and flexible with requirements you can hire graduates quicker. A wait of three or four months will significantly affect your time to market, and if that's critical (as it often is with startups) hiring contractors initially is a good option.

It's always important to balance the amount of effort needed to source candidates with the service provided by recruitment consultants. Many recruitment consultants are actively trying to work with startups and will be willing to lower their rates to get your business, also being flexible with payment of their fees; spreading them monthly over 3-6 months to help cash flow. For contractors a good recruiter will often be able to get 3-4 possible candidates to you for interview within a day or two, ready for them to start the following week. When you do get candidates through from recruiters they will "own" that CV for a specified period of time (this is negotiable); if you hire that person for any role within the period the recruiter will be due their fee.

Personally I've found workinstartups.com to be the best source of inbound candidates, although still use Linkedin and Jobserve just in case.

Searching Linkedin to find potential candidates is a good option; both for current hires and to build relationships with people who may become future hires. A personalised message to each person when you connect, identifying why you think they are good candidates for you is a great way to make a personal connection, an important part of the hiring process. You can template much of it of course, and mix in some personalised information about their skills and experience relevant to what you need.

Make sure you setup a system to track candidates; this can just be an excel spreadsheet, or you could use a CRM system. Track each candidates personal and contact details, the role they're applying for, where they applied from, salary / rate expectations what stage they're at in your process and any important information you're able to glean during the process. If the candidate has come via a recruiter, include the date their ownership of the CV ends, which can be important in future hiring to avoid fees being due. I've recently discovered contactually, a personal CRM system that looks pretty interesting.

# Choosing a tech stack

I'll write more about this in a subsequent post, but before hiring you need to decide loosely what technologies you want to use as this will radically affect the people you hire. As a technical founder this should be reasonably straight forward however if you're a non-technical founder you need to sit down with someone with 5/10 years + experience, that can think strategically about your business and put together an outline plan including a target architecture and delivery schedule. An initial pass at this shouldn't take more than a day and will save you from the kind of costly mistakes a less experienced team could make. Shameless plug : If you don't have that type of person in your network, drop me a line.

# Team composition

My ideal starting team structure is 2 mid-level developers, with 3-5 years of experience, able to cover most if not all of the stack between them. 1 devops person full time in the office, supplemented with 1 tester / business analyst if you can afford it. As many as possible of these will be permanent employees, however I'll start with contractors initially while continuing to search.

As well as implementation, this core team takes responsibility for turning loosely defined business ideas into technical solutions, guiding more junior members and reviewing the work being done is fit for purpose.

I then build out the rest of the team around the product roadmap, with a combination of remote workers, paid interns, work experience and apprentices. Each remote worker works closely with a local hire, to make sure that they're constantly communicated with and supported, ensuring they don't become isolated.
