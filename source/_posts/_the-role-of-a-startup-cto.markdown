During my time running and mentoring startups, and in general discussions with other small businesses I've seen a general misunderstanding of what a CTO should be bringing to a business. It's often the assumption that a CTO is just a very good developer, maybe with some project management, agile experience so they can plan and manage people.

Whilst these two skills are important, for me they are the skills of a technical lead, rather than a CTO. A technical lead is concerned with how to deliver a prescribed set of features, often with a prescribed set of technologies, patterns and processes. They're often involved in the selection of these things, and are considering them from the perspective of what they are doing right now, but somebody else makes the decisions.

A CTO on the other hand should be appraising technology in the context of the businesses vision, which boils down to the questions:


# Are we building the right thing?

* Pre sales consultancy
* Product idea creation and definition
* Backlog management, prioritisation and tracking



# Are we building it in the right way?
* 

Innovation

How can latest tech be applied

The orchestration of Biz, ops, product and development

Are we building the right thing?

Are we building it in the right way?
- Questioning implementation details and refining
- Staffing, team structure & skills (training etc)
- Tool, technology and processes appraisal and selection
- Non-Functional Requirements (cost, scalability, availability, security, maintainability etc)
- Overall architecture vision, how should the concerns across the overall solution be separated, what makes sense from the point of view of NFRs, the team needed to build/maintain it, etc
- API/Schema design
- Code reviews
- Where are the bottle necks

Getting your hands dirty
- Whilst you don't need to be an expert in every technology the startup uses, I believe you do need to be an expert in at least one of them. This allows you to get deep and dirty with the team and "prove your chops".
