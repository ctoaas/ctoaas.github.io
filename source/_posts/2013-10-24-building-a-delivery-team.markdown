One of the most satisfying parts of my roles has been creating technical delivery teams; these are the engine room of a tech business. You often hear about a "10x" increase in productivity between an average developer and a "rock star" developer, but for me that pales into comparison compared to the differences created by the interactions between members of a team.

There are plenty of businesses where technology isn't important, where software is used, perhaps with a bit of customisation, or they may have a website for marketing. Those businesses can probably ignore most of this; this article is addressed at businesses who at their core require the creation and maintenance of software assets.

This article is focused on the early start-up phase of these types of organisations, where typically a single product is being built by a delivery team of less than 20. There are changes that need to be made on the way to this size, but as it grows beyond 20, and significantly more people on the business side this model starts to fall down.

It's important for their to be no boundaries between the different parts of the business; this keeps everybody up to date on what's happening, helps identify potential issues and keeps the momentum and focus. A daily all-hands standup focused on work in progress that day and the previous day is the best tool for this.

# Hiring

Hiring good developers is hard; finding good candidates is very difficult and current market rates, especially in the UK and US are rising in line with the increased demand and constrained supply. It's not unusual now to see senior developer rates close to Â£100k in London, and even with the expansion of seed stage investment you're not going to get far. For this reason I feel it's important to develop an "alternative" talent pipeline, bringing in "fresh" talent in a low-cost, low-risk way to supplement your more senior hires.

Many recent graduates are unemployable for startups, having not spent enough time programming during their degree courses to be effective when they start. This makes them a nett negative on productivity of the team initially, and from that perspective I feel unpaid internships are fair, but I am against unpaid internships because they exclude people who can't afford to participate, and part of an alternative talent pipeline is it should be casting the net as wide as possible.

The job centre offers up-to 2 month paid work youngsters on job-seekers, free for the business. Designing a program to bring in suitable people (those with an interest in programming, graphic design, marketing, video, etc) and combine a portion of their time dedicated to a project in their interest area with the more mundane data / admin / manual tasks that need to be done in a startup provides both parties with a valuable experience. Where appropriate the participants can progress onto either a formal apprenticeship, or an entry level role / paid internship at the end of their 2 months.

When hiring for these programs I'm looking for motivated, personable people with evidence that they have a genuine interest in the area, that they've "got off their a@*e" and done something to progress it. As a group the young and unemployed get a bad press, but I've been fortunate enough to spend time with large groups of them, and there is a sizeable subset of people that just haven't found / been given the right opportunity.

Paid internships provide a way for people with some experience (educational or work) to continue learning their craft without too much expense on the business. Having interns in the team environment; working in the VCS and work tracking system, learning a number of the tools in use in the team, contributing as a junior developer where they can, and being involved in the conversations and debate that occur in a startup office accelerate their learning and reduce the amount of time until they provide value.

Apprenticeships are another option that allows people to learn their skills with a combination of work and formal learning; in my opinion more youngsters should be taking this option as an alternative to degrees. Bear in mind that apprenticeships are 1-2 year programs so aren't appropriate for everyone.

[I've written before about how to structure a learning program from complete novice](http://www.ctoaas.co/blog/2013/10/21/how-should-i-get-started-coding/), and I tailor a program along these lines for technology apprentices and interns. This program can take a complete novice through to a junior developer role in six to twelve months as long as they're committed.

# The benefits of remote workers

I've spent a lot of time working with offshore development organisations across Eastern Europe, North America and India, Asia, with varying degrees of success. Having team members in cheaper locations can significantly reduce your costs but this is often be outweighed by a fall in productivity in both the remote team members and those locally who work with them. 

There is a massive cultural difference between the different outsourcing locations, and I won't go into the differences here, but my experience to date has led me to stick to Eastern Europe and avoid India and Asia. 


# Team composition

My ideal starting team structure is 2 mid-level developers (able to cover most if not all of the stack between them) and 1 devops person full time in the office, supplemented with 1 tester / business analyst if you can afford it. I then build out the rest of the team around the product roadmap, with a combination of remote workers, paid interns, work experience and apprentices.

I believe everything should be automated

In terms of staffing the team, I


testers, BAs, devops

tools - lifecycle management, version control, document repository (gdocs, dropbox, confluence)

Checkpoints
