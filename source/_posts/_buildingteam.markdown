# Team composition

My ideal starting team structure is 2 mid-level developers (able to cover most if not all of the stack between them) and 1 devops person full time in the office, supplemented with 1 tester / business analyst if you can afford it. I then build out the rest of the team around the product roadmap, with a combination of remote workers, paid interns, work experience and apprentices.

I believe everything should be automated

In terms of staffing the team, I


testers, BAs, devops

tools - lifecycle management, version control, document repository (gdocs, dropbox, confluence)
; google hangouts, skype and group chat tools like hipchat/campfire etc, and online work item tracking tools all
