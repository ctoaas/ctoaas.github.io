I've seen a number of teams who proclaim to be 'doing agile', with varying levels of success. For me, and especially where the team isn't in a complex environment (i.e. a hierarchy of agile teams / scrums of scrums, etc), the major benefit of agile is that it allows the team to be as efficient as possible, delivering as much business value as possible.

Agile is often used as a positive spin on disorganised, and this actually accerbates the problem; both through the differences between reality and what is presented to customers, prospective team members and other stakeholders, and because of the additional process and work associated with agile (retrospectives, planning sessions) that are ineffective and waste time when not used properly.

* The team is empowered to deliver, and to modify their development process
