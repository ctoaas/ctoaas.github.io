The orchestration of Biz, ops, product and development

Are we building the right thing?
- Pre sales consultancy
- Product idea creation and definition
- Backlog management, prioritisation and tracking
- Questioning implementation details and refining

Are we building it in the right way?
- Staffing, team structure & skills (training etc)
- Tool, technology and processes appraisal and selection
- Non-Functional Requirements (cost, scalability, availability, security, maintainability etc)
- Overall architecture vision, how should the concerns across the overall solution be separated, what makes sense from the point of view of NFRs, the team needed to build/maintain it, etc
- API/Schema design
- Code reviews

Getting your hands dirty
- Whilst you don't need to be an expert in every technology the startup uses, I believe you do need to be an expert in at least one of them. This allows you to get deep and dirty with the team and "prove your chops".
