  <p>I&rsquo;ve been spending a lot of time recently thinking about what the next 3-5 years should look like for me. There are a number of options available to technologists, each with their own positives and negatives. When facing problems like this I like to get quantitive; figure out a model, put my options into it and then have it inform my decision.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d broadly categorise the options available as:</p>

<ul>
<li>A stable SME/larger corporation &ndash; the traditional option; becoming a small part of a large corporation. You&rsquo;ll get a market rate salary, good benefits and career progression opportunities, but little in the way of equity. Depending on seniority you may not get much of an ability to control how you do your job, with things dictated from above, and you may find yourself working on the same things for an extended period of time.</li>
<li>Join an agency or consultancy &ndash; brought in by other companies for specific projects, they offer a wide variety of work, good benefits and market rate salaries.</li>
<li>Start your own consultancy / go freelance &ndash; Flexible and well paid, the market is currently hot but there&rsquo;s no long term guarantee of work other than being good at what you do (and even then it could potentially dry up). Unless you grow it into an agency or large professional services company there&rsquo;s little equity.</li>
<li>Company builders &ndash; these are companies that build and spin out new companies. You&rsquo;ll get a lot of support from the host company, allowing you to focus on those bits unique to your business and you&rsquo;ll have a decent amount of funding to ensure you can hire as you&rsquo;ll need to. You won&rsquo;t have as much autonomy as a pure startup.</li>
<li>Join / start a seed stage start-up &ndash; The chance to shape a company as you want to see it, the pace will be manic, the role fluid and you need to create / prove everything from scratch; the tech stack, business model, customer acquisition, sales process, admin processes, etc, but it gives you the opportunity to be a core part of a large idea. Incubators, accelerators and co-working spaces can all help to provide a support community around you. You&rsquo;ll earn a lower salary, but will have a larger equity allocation giving you more of the potential upside.</li>
<li>Join a later stage startup &ndash; These will have a proven biz model and traction, and now need to scale it up to more customers. Can be anything from a group of 5 with £1m to a team of hundreds with £100m+. You&rsquo;ll be able to earn a salary close to market rate and will get equity, giving you a potential upside in-line with the stage at which you join.</li>
</ul>


<p>In making the decision, I think about the attributes of the roles that I care about, giving each attribute a score out of 10. I then think about how each option fares for each attribute, noting my thoughts (so I can recall it in future), also giving this a score from 10. For this decision I care about:</p>

<ul>
<li>Salary (score = 6) : How much will I be paid annually, including bonuses, commission, benefits, etc. This is moderately important to me.</li>
<li>3-5 yr financial outcome (9) : A combination of the amount of equity offered, the potential value and the likelyhood of it happening. Very important to me.</li>
<li>Stability (5) : How long have they been around? If appropriate how long is their runway?</li>
<li>Role (7.5) : What will I be doing?</li>
<li>Tech stack (6) : What technology are they using? How much room for change is there?</li>
<li>Market (7) : Are they working in an area that interests me?</li>
<li>Team (9) : Who else will I be working with? How suitable are they for the business they&rsquo;re building?</li>
<li>Vision (9) : Where do they want to get to?</li>
<li>Location (7) : Where are they based? How does that align to my agenda?</li>
</ul>


<p>I then multiply these things together; so the score for each option by the importance of the option, adding them all together to give an overall score for the option &ndash; the higher the score the better the option. It was interesting to go through this excercise and the results support what I had been thinking qualitatively. It&rsquo;s also easy now to plug in other options that arise and see how they compare.</p>

<p>You can see the result of my analysis in the attached spreadsheet <a href="/assets/files/CareerOptions-Shared.xlsx">here</a> &ndash; I&rsquo;ve removed any sensitive information, but feel free to clear it down and use it to model your own decisions.</p>

  <p>I&rsquo;ve seen a number of teams who proclaim to be &lsquo;doing agile&rsquo;, with varying levels of success. For me, and especially where the team isn&rsquo;t in a complex environment (i.e. a hierarchy of agile teams / scrums of scrums, etc), the major benefit of agile is that it allows the team to be as efficient as possible, delivering as much business value as possible.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve also seen agile often used as a positive spin on being disorganised; simply having little or no documentation, design or process does not an agile team make! A team in this state, using agile vocabulary actually compounds the problem; both through the differences between reality and what is presented to customers, prospective team members and other stakeholders, and because of the additional process and work associated with agile (retrospectives, planning sessions) that are ineffective and waste time when not used properly.</p>

<p>Below are some common traits I&rsquo;ve seen in good teams, and how to spot when they may not be correct, I&rsquo;ve often seen the opposite of these in teams and they can be easily spotted by talking to individuals in the team; you&rsquo;ll often hear complaints, moaning and general dissatisfaction around these themes.</p>

<ul>
<li>The team either has an empowered sponsor / business owner available at least 80% of the time, or there is a good understanding of the acceptance criteria for work items being delivered. If you regularly have situations where the sponsors expectations aren&rsquo;t met, this is likely to be the issue.</li>
<li>The backlog is managed sensibly, with work coming into the backlog and the team managing it through the process. Work coming in directly to individuals is a common indication this isn&rsquo;t happening.</li>
<li>Work item estimation is done with a good understanding of what the scope / acceptance criteria are. Estimations based on a one line description are unlikely to be accurate.</li>
<li>The team has an appropriate development process for their situation. If the team is less than ten people, in one room, a simple wall board should suffice. If you have remote team members you need to think about how they interact with it.</li>
<li>The team is empowered to deliver, and to modify their development process. This should be handled in the retrospective with the team optimising as appropriate.</li>
<li>The team has a culture of code quality, especially tests. You often see a reluctance to refactor code when a codebase has insufficient tests.</li>
<li>The team has an engaged daily standup with a small amount, but not too much, back and forth between team members. A flat, boring update with everyone giving a 15 second update to the team leader doesn&rsquo;t really add value.</li>
<li>The team regularly contribute to each others features, through discussion, review, pairing and testing. A group of people working in isolation does not equal a team.</li>
<li>The team ships regularly, whether this is to a UAT environment, or live features are being deployed regularly. If the shorter of a month, or two iterations go by and this hasn&rsquo;t happened, it&rsquo;s a bad sign.</li>
</ul>


<p>Note I didn&rsquo;t say you need to produce reams of documentation for this stuff, putting stuff &lsquo;on paper&rsquo; and storing them somewhere centrally does help the team be explicit about expectations, but isn&rsquo;t essential.</p>

<p>Do you recognise any of them in your team?</p>

  <p>As part of a new business I&rsquo;m setting up, I wanted to get a simple blog system online. In the past I&rsquo;ve used Wordpress, and although I hate PHP have never found anything that made sense as an alternative.</p>

<p>For me the criteria for an alternative were :
&ndash; Written in a language platform I was interested in &ndash; this is pretty much any common, current web stack, except PHP.
&ndash; Feature rich with the ability to extend it, an abundence of extensions and an active community.
&ndash; Has a straightforward and cheap cloud deployment mechanism.</p>

<p>But thinking about it again recently I&rsquo;m more interested in:
&ndash; Has a straightforward and cheap cloud deployment mechanism.
&ndash; Very little maintenance requirement &ndash; a static deployment to S3 would be perfect
&ndash; Allowing the post content to be edited locally in text files, in an open format
&ndash; Have a number of themes available, so that I only need to pick one and write some content and off I go
&ndash; This is less of a priority but I&rsquo;m using node JS on a project I&rsquo;m working on at the moment, which I&rsquo;m new to, so any coding (extensions, templates, etc) being in Javascript would be ideal</p>

<p>This led me towards Blacksmith, <a href="https://github.com/flatiron/blacksmith,">https://github.com/flatiron/blacksmith,</a> using an S3 static website for the hosting. I was pretty close to moving forward with this, but couldn&rsquo;t find much in the way of themes. I&rsquo;ve now settled (I think) on Octopress, and probably github pages for the hosting. I have a basic understanding of Ruby, and haven&rsquo;t used it in anger &ndash; but I assume I&rsquo;ll be able to pick it up should I need to.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll now document the install process from my Mac.</p>

<p>I started by following these articles:</p>

<pre><code>http://miguelcamba.com/blog/2013/04/22/tutorial-create-a-blog-with-octopress-and-host-it-in-github-pages/
</code></pre>

<p>The first issue I received was when running rake deploy, which returned this error:</p>

<pre><code>"You have already activated rake 10.1.0, but your Gemfile requires rake 0.9.2.2. Using bundle exec may solve this."
</code></pre>

<p>Running &ldquo;bundle exec rake install&rdquo; fixed this.</p>

<p>The same went for the next few bundle commands, resolved using:</p>

<pre><code>bundle exec rake setup_github_pages
bundle exec rake deploy
</code></pre>

<p>When running this deployment task I received the error:</p>

<pre><code>## Pushing generated _deploy website
To -- removed for security --
 ! [rejected]        master -&gt; master (non-fast-forward)
error: failed to push some refs to '-- removed for security --'
hint: Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind
hint: its remote counterpart. Merge the remote changes (e.g. 'git pull')
hint: before pushing again.
</code></pre>

<p>One tip &ndash; when creating the repo in github, don&rsquo;t specify a git ignore or a licence and this issue seems to be avoided. I did find a solution to this on stack overflow : <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17609453/rake-gen-deploy-rejected-in-octopress">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17609453/rake-gen-deploy-rejected-in-octopress</a></p>

<pre><code>Edit the Rakefile and look for this line:

system "git push origin #{deploy_branch}"
Alter the line by adding a plus (+) before the #{deploy_branch} tag:

system "git push origin +#{deploy_branch}"
</code></pre>
